The municipality of Madrid offers a lot of data to start from and, by visiting the open data portal, you can find lots of datasets.

Our focus is, in particular, on green and therefore we ask you to include at least one of these datasets:

Important note:
the data is released under a CC-BY license.
In some cases the dataset does not yet cover the entire territory of Madrid, but it is more than enough for our purposes.

Thank you!
